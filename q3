D.  Consider the following PYTHON code for the MNode class given below.
    What is the difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes?
    Explain the difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java.
    Which language do you prefer?  Explain why.

    import hashlib

class MNode:

    pay=0
    left=0
    right=0

    def __init__(self, pay, left, right):
        self.pay=pay
        self.left=left
        self.right=right

    def merge(self, other):
        hashe=hashlib.sha256(self.pay+other.pay).hexdigest()
        return MNode(hashe,this,other)

    def getI(self, i):
        read=self
        bi=bin(i)[2:]
        for x in range(1, len(bi)):
            if bi[x]=='0':
                if read.left==0:
                    return 0
                else:
                    read=read.left
        
            else:
                if read.right==0:
                    return 0
                else:
                    read=read.right
        
        return read

A. The Public and Private key pair comprise of two uniquely related cryptographic keys (basically long random numbers)
   The Public Key is what its name suggests - Public. It is made available to everyone via a publicly accessible repository or directory. 
   On the other hand, the Private Key must remain confidential to its respective owner.
   Because the key pair is mathematically related, whatever is encrypted with a Public Key may only be decrypted by its corresponding Private Key and vice versa.
B. My favourite Java project this semester was the signature project becasue I think it is interesting and it shows more what we
   can do with Java. The two things I learned:
   - You will need the Private key for the document
   - The security of the files that we can use with these keys.
   Two ways the project could improve:
   - More complicated way to log in with the private key because there could be people that can break without the private key.
   - Better encryption methods.
C. Advantages:
   - Code Reuse and Recycling: Objects created for Object Oriented Programs can easily be reused in other programs.
   - Design Benefits: Large programs are very difficult to write. Object Oriented Programs force designers to go through an extensive planning phase,
   which makes for better designs with less flaws.
   Disadvantages:
   -Effort: Object Oriented programs require a lot of work to create
   -Speed: Object Oriented programs are slower than other programs, partially because of their size.
D. Phyton is compact and easier with less work to do. Java is more powerful than Phyton.
   I prefer Java it is more work but you could do more in Java than Phython.
