A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.

C.  Write a class for an element doublely-linked list.

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    
A. Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
   One of the classic problems for introducing recursion is calculating the factorial of an integer.
   The method will call itself, and it will execute the code inside, which is to call itself, 
    so it will execute the code inside of that method, which is to call itself, so it will execute that code.
B. A stack is defined as a list or sequence of elements that is lengthened by placing new elements "on top" 
   of existing elements and shortened by removing elements from the top of existing elements.  
   A queue is a sequence of elements that is added to by placing the new element at the rear of 
   existing and shortened by removing elements in front of queue.
C. private static class Node<AnyType>
{
   private AnyType data;
   private Node<AnyType> next;

   public Node(AnyType data, Node<AnyType> next)
   {
      this.data = data;
      this.next = next;
   }
} 
D. Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes.
   Hash trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. 
   Currently the main use of hash trees is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, 
   and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks.
